### 2.2. [NESMA](https://nesma.org/freedocs/nesma-on-sizing-function-point-analysis/0)

Areas where measurement and metrics can help .Many areas in the IT industry benefit from metrics. On her website Nesma offers information about software measurement, software metrics and the way they could be and should be applied in practice. 

[Nesma Guidelines](https://nesma.org/themes/)

The information is structured in six themes:

- [Benchmarking of software projects](https://nesma.org/themes/benchmarking/) - Do I get value for money? 
- [Outsourcing of software projects/contracts](https://nesma.org/themes/outsourcing/) - Guidelines for RFPâ€™s
- [Productivity measurement and management](https://nesma.org/themes/productivity/challenges-productivity-meaurement/) - Why should I measure productivity? 
- [Project Control](https://nesma.org/themes/project-control/) - Do you have control over a project?
- [Estimating cost in software projects](https://nesma.org/themes/estimating/) - Which steps do I need to follow to estimate a budget for a project based on FPA?
- [Sizing methods](https://nesma.org/themes/sizing/) - Why determine the size of my software product?
- [Software Size measures - 1](https://nesma.org/2015/05/software-size-measures-and-their-use-in-software-project-cost-estimation/) - use in software project estimation 
- [Software Size measures - 2](https://nesma.org/2015/07/software-size-measures-and-their-use-in-software-project-estimation-part-2/)-- use in software project estimation
